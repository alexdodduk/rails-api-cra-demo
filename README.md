# Rails API & React Demo

This is a simple web app that uses React and a Rails API. Based on the [fullstack React guide](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/)

## Running

```
rake start
```

will use Foreman to start the Rails API on port 3002 and the React app on port 3001 similtaneously.

Then simply go to [your localhost](http://localhost:3001) to view the app!
